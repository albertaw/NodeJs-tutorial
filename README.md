# Node.js Tutorial

What is Node.js? Node.js (node) is a tool that lets you run JavaScript outside of a browser. It is also a library which allows you to download code made by other developers and manage the code in your projects. These packaged units of code are referred to as modules.  Node comes with it's own core modules, but to extend its functionality you will use module contributed by the community via the node package
manager (also known as npm). 

Why node? If you are already know JavaScript, you can build a full
stack app quicker because you won't have to learn a new server side
language. Also, node is good for building applications that need to update data in real time.  This is because of JavaScript's asynchronous programming style.  

This tutorial is designed to teach you node by building an example app.
Each lesson builds upon the previous lesson and will allow you to apply
what you have learned with hands on exercises.  This tutorial assumes you have knowlege of JavaScript (programming fundamentals, higher order
functions, callbacks), git, and using a terminal.
